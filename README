This is my personal blog/page/whatever where sometimes, I write about programming.

This project uses jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/).


Start
-----

- bundle exec jekyll serve


Problems with assets?
---------------------

Delete _site folder.


Create a new post
-----------------

Use the script located in scripts/new_post.sh to start with a base
and a few variables defined (date, name, etc.)

Example:

bash ./scripts/new_post.sh "This is my title"
