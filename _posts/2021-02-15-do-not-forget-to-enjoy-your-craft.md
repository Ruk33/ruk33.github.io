When was the last time you enjoyed what you do? I mean, I'm talking about 
development, software, applications, the stuff that needs to get done for 
yesterday; the stuff that can't take what it SHOULD take; the stuff that 
you can't clean up and refactor because a new feature is coming upright
in the next corner. I'm talking about your craft. When was the last time 
you enjoyed it?

## This is just a reminder

We live in rushing times. Everyone is rush to do everything and, it's pretty
easy to get caught up in this shit. It's pretty easy to wake up hating what
you do because you know you are delivering below your quality to make up
for the crazy deadlines. I know, you can't take forever either to deliver
otherwise you wouldn't be building anything. But then again, having to deliver entire features, pages, applications in a matter of weeks or even days? Shit
got out of control. That's why software development sucks and why it's full 
of bugs.

## You gotta be productive, man!

And the trend continues, it seems like today, every framework, every library,
every tool is focused on that, "productivity" Are you productive? here, check this 
out, build a crap application in a matter of minutes and then continue to give 
the illusion that software is that easy and can be shipped in this little time. 
Enjoying what you do? What are you talking about? There is no time for that!
PRODUCTIVITY IS KING.

## Enjoy the little things

So as I said, this is just a reminder (or maybe a rant... yeah, rant may be appropriate too). Remember to take a few minutes from your busy day to enjoy what you do.
